# Hanabi
Create a AI that plays Hanabi

The current version only uses Q-learning.  One can create an instance by running
main.py and then the following in the console:

```
instance = wrapper()
```

and train with

```
instance.train(1)
```

See the comments for the options under wrapper for a description of available
options.

Also includes the hanabi environment, written by me.
